## For programmers

Make sure you have [Go 1.22 or later](https://go.dev/) to contribute to the game

To build the game yourself, run: `go build .` it will produce an freefall file and on Windows freefall.exe.

To run the tests, run: `go test ./...` assuming there even are any.

The project has a very simple, flat structure, the first place to start looking is the main.go file.
